                        The Career Training College is an approved provider of the government's ICT50220 Diploma of Information Technology course through Jobs and Skills WA, under the Participation – Work Readiness program. Career Training College conducts numerous events every month for its students as part of the Job Ready Program. Until now, all participants' names have been manually recorded. As a result, the event manager has decided to keep a record of active participants as active members for these events. Active members will be registered by the event manager on the "Career Training College Event Team" website, based on the participants' interests. Since the members are listed in the website's system, it simplifies the process for the event manager to notify these members about any new updates or events.
